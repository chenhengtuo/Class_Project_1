Step 0: inFile <- open from argv[1]
outFile1, outFile2 <- open from argv[2], argv[3].
Step 1: S <- creates a LLStack using constructor.
Step 2: buildStack(S, inFile, outFile1) 
Step 3: close inFile
Step 4: re-open inFile 
Step 5: Q <- creates a LLQueue using constructor.
Step 6: buildQueue (inFile, outFile2) 
Step 7: close inFile
